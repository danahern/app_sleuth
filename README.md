# AppSleuth

AppSleuth is a gem that will collect and display information about your project.  This should, hopefully, make the designer's life a lot easier.  It will display what colors your site uses and where.  What fonts you're using and where.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'app_sleuth'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install app_sleuth

## Usage

Open up terminal and run
```app_sleuth```

This will parse your project then start up a server on localhost port 4567.  From there just browse to the site and enjoy the information.
